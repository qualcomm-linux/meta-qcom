Subject: [PATCH 1/3] arm64: dts: qcom: qcs615: Add Command DB support

Command DB is a database in the shared memory of QCOM SoCs, that
provides a mapping between resource key and the resource address for a
system resource managed by a remote processor. The data is stored in a
shared memory region and is loaded by the remote processor. Therefore,
enabling Command DB ensures that those resources function properly.
